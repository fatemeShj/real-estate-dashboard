This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Real Estate Property Management Application

This project is a work in progress. It is a real estate property management application built using Next.js, React Query, TanStack Form, and Zustand. The application allows users to submit property details and store them in the database, with client-side validation, SSR, and dynamic routing.
Features (WIP)

    Form Handling with TanStack Form: This project uses TanStack Form for form management and validation.

    Data Submission with React Query: Submitting property data is done using React Query with server-side mutation handling.

    Client-Side Validation: Uses schema validation to ensure correct data submission before sending to the server.

    Dynamic Routing: The app supports dynamic routes for property listings and form submissions.

    State Management: Zustand is used for managing the global state of the application.

    SSR: Server-side rendering is enabled for better SEO and faster initial page load.

Technologies Used

    Next.js: Framework for building the React application.

    React Query: A powerful data-fetching and state management library for handling asynchronous data.

    TanStack Form: A library to handle form validation, submission, and state management.

    Zustand: A minimal state management library for managing global application state.

    Tailwind CSS: For utility-first CSS styling.
